This version of Apple Pie one cannot eat, you can spell though!
In this game the user is asked to play a "guess the word game", he or she only has 7 attempts to guess the word before it's game over.
If a work is guessed incorrectly an apple will dissappear from the tree, once there are no more apples the game is over.

This application is created with the SWIFT guidance book as tutor.
